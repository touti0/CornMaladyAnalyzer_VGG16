# CornMaladyAnalyzer_VGG16
# Corn Diseases Classifier

## Overview

This project classifies corn diseases using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model can identify:
1- Northern Leaf Blight 
2- Common Rust 
3- Gray Leaf Spot 
4- Healthy Corn

## Dataset
available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafishamoin/new-bangladeshi-crop-disease?rvi=1

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohsen-29/corn-diseases-classifier.git

   Open the Jupyter Notebook:

2. **Run the Notebook:** 
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CornMaladyAnalyzer_VGG16.ipynb

   Step through each cell to load the dataset, preprocess the images, and train the model.
   The notebook will guide you through data augmentation, model training, and evaluation phases.
